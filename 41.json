The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  BF1 isn\u2019t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that. As someone who is more on the \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women\u2019s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game\u2019s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. That\u2019s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character\u2019s presence in the game\u2019s setting. Even the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the \u201cfor the Tsar\u201d DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.9/10Only gave it a 9 \u2018cause the 1 is already there\u2026\t\t\t\n"]
