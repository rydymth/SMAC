The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.  I found it was full of trolls.  Don't waste your time with Red Dead Online.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t938 people found this review helpful120 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n82.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 3 June, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst chapter: Yee haw I'm a cowboyLast chapter: Red Dead DepressionIn all seriousness, One of the greatest games ever made.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t922 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n117.5 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 5 July, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe game is incredible but why the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 I have to connect rockstar games servers to play single player.

And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t685 people found this review helpful107 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n133.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 25 July, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI was having a beer in Valentine Saloon and some loud mouth drunk guy at a table was yelling about how many Indians he's killed and how everyone should thank him, what a stand up guy. I walked over and greeted him and he said \"Who the hell you talking to?\" then stood up and punched my hat right off of my head.We punched the hell out of each other and were both covered in blood. My health was nearly gone but then he ragdolled and faceplanted the table and a message popped up on screen saying something like \"You can no longer use the barber\".Turns out i just beat the crap out of the local barber.The sheriff came, i surrendered and spent the night in a cell. I had to pay $4.I went back to the saloon for another beer and a random guy walks up and talks about the fight i had the night before and how crazy it was.This is just one of many small immersive things which have happened so far outside of the main story.What a crazy game.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t662 people found this review helpful61 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n60.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 14 July, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIs there a pill I can eat to forget everything? because I would eat it to play this game again\t\t\t\n"]
