You always launch a \"last run\" and you end up at 4AM.This game did \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up my sleeping schedule more than Netflix.Amazing job, with a great balance between new content based on what the community want and new content from their hands with regular updates.Basically a 3 man's studio being more professional than much larger  studio  slot machines.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t387 people found this review helpful55 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n148.6 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 3 October, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.
