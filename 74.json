All the negative reviews had me quite concerned about whether I should buy the game.  However, I'm glad I did and the game deserves a lot of credit.  It does almost everything right.  I was able to play local co-op with my daughter with no issues.  The gameplay is smooth, fun, sound and graphics are quite good and so far I've been very impressed with map variety.  AI is at least as good as Gang Beasts.  I'm glad I decided to buy, and for me the lack of offline play and the microtransactions are non issues and it does not effect my experience.  I don't plan on paying for microtransactions (unless they release a frog, then I might drop some cash).  I've only played custom games with local co-op and have had no issues with lag.    As a fan of Gang Beasts, Boomerang-fu, Stick Fight the Game, Rounds, A Gummy Life - I can recommend this game.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t156 people found this review helpful58 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n13.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 12 November, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI enjoy this game as much as the next person. I enjoy throwing paws with my friends. That is if I had any. However, there is one thing that I wish the game had. An opossum character to play as. They would be the perfect animal to add to this game and I await their addition. This is not a request, it is a demand and a threat. You will catch these paws otherwise.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t779 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n7.5 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 4 December, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFun game to play with online friends (not really a local co op party game), but too pricey for what it is. Especially when considering the heavy microtransactions and gatcha mechanics. Sell at a expensive price, or go f2p with microtransactions. Rage against double dipping in all games!\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,940 people found this review helpful109 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n12.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 11 October, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the love of god remove the punishment for leaving games, i got a 2 minute timeout for cancelling the QUEUE, thats ridiculous.
