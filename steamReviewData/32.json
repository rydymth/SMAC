He wouldn't really have anything to do so one day, he went to the store and bought Counter-Strike (it was back then when you needed a disc to play; steam wasn't around yet). and he would play until she got home. 14 years later on Saturday, April 15th 2017, he personally bought me and my little brother copies of Counter-Strike so we can all play together. This game brought my family closer together ever since the divorce.10/10, best game ever. \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t485 people found this review helpful566 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n195.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 1 December, 2015\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcant buy skins, cases, keys, stickers - gaben cant steal our money10/10 would play again\t\t\t\n"]
