The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to sciencePortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I\u2019ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn\u2019t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to T2: Judgement Day when it comes to rating sequels. I\u2019ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.Pros+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. +Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. +Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can\u2019t think of any game topping this. +Stephen Merchant and J.K Simmons did an absolutely terrific job. Ellen McLain\u2019s performance as GladOS is so good that you\u2019ll love to hate her character. So, then it\u2019s a success I guess :D+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s dark but most importantly it\u2019s original!+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. +Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. +Excellent soundtrack and musical score by Mike Morasky and The National. +Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. +User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you\u2019re done with the main story. +Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it\u2019s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. +Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you\u2019re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There\u2019s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. +Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. +One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don\u2019t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. Cons-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you\u2019ve watched a lot of movies and TV.-Most assets seem like they\u2019re copied straight from previous Valve\u2019s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. -Honestly, I\u2019ve tried hard to find and couldn\u2019t. At this point I\u2019m just nitpicking Valve.  The Bottom LinePortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there\u2019s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson; perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I\u2019m thankful for that.The developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website. Just search the name on Google or any other search engine that you prefer. Highly recommend it to\u2026\u2026everyone. If you\u2019ve read so far then you\u2019re probably interested in the game so won\u2019t hurt giving it a try. My Rating: 10/10  Thank You :D\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,309 people found this review helpful404 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n30.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 3 June, 2017\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGreat game, makes you feel somewhat smart\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t223 people found this review helpful146 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n27.6 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 11 December, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti played it as a kid and now i wanna get bullied by older women\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t378 people found this review helpful193 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n3.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 13 August, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStep 1: Get gameStep 2: Play gameStep 3: Be smartStep 4: Beat gameStep 5: Tell friend to get gameStep 6: Play multiplayerStep 7: Scream at them for being stupidStep 8: Feel good about yourself\t\t\t\n"]
