Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it\u2019s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it\u2019s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game\u2019s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3\u2019s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I\u2019m stuck on one mission that I simply can\u2019t seem to complete.)However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I\u2019m sure there are so many others that I haven\u2019t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,606 people found this review helpful822 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n170.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 25 February, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSo realistic that people get bamboozled with ARMA III clips uploaded as real war footage.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,295 people found this review helpful735 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n3,081.3 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 5 December, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2400 hours spent playing arma when I could have gotten a girlfriend instead, oh well, great game though. 10/10\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t771 people found this review helpful25 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t97\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n326.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 2 March, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeen playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It\u2019s grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I\u2019ve ever experienced in a videogame. It\u2019s one of those games which, when it finally \u2018clicks\u2019 with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It\u2019s not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. I\u2019ll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I\u2019ll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates \u2014 it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I\u2019ll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia \u2014 you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you\u2019ll laugh through it. ARMA is unlike any other game \u2014 any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t5,372 people found this review helpful129 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n17.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 15 June, 2017\nImmersive & trying // Recommended for those that cherish depth & complexity*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives+ Enormous map/playable area+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to masterLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,140 people found this review helpful484 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t37\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n25,373.3 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 28 December, 2015\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with Arma 3, I would certainly recommend it to others.

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.That is what this game is about.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t358 people found this review helpful143 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n1,634.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 17 May, 2020\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIts starts with you buying it on a sale because you want another shooter, find out that its not that kind of a shooter and stop playing it for 3 months minimum. Decide to give it another shot but play by its rules and you find that you actually enjoy its complexity. Then somebody comes over and says, you wanna try this but Vietnam and also be in a unit with other \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that enjoy this game and you say yes because Vietnam sounds awesome (Spoiler: Its not) and you want to play with a more organized group. When you wake up, you have spent 4 years playing with the same group of people, while having 20 FPS on lowest settings and the game is keeping 1 of your week days hostage as you have scheduled events every week. You also subscribe to the Steam forums and check reddit to find more victims to sacrifice to BI so as to have their next patch not \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up all the 58+ mods you are using 1 hour before your operations...What Im trying to say is: ARMA is not a game, simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it. Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for \"lols\", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it. ARMA is everything and nothing and I cant recommend it enough.  \n"]
