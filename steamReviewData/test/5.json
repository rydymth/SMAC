That's what MW2022 uses.Ever feel like one day you're on a roll, but the next day you can't win a single game? There's a reason for that.Here's one quote from Activision's EOMM patent they renewed in 2019 (source[patents.google.com]):Originally posted by Activision Patent US10857468B2:     ...responsive to a determination that the first player purchased the in-game item, the player profile may be updated to reflect the purchase and the first player may be matched to play a second gameplay session in which the in-game item is suitable to be used.    For example, if the in-game item is a weapon (e.g., an accurate and powerful sniper rifle), the second gameplay session may be selected because the weapon is highly effective in the second gameplay session. Doing so may encourage the first player to make subsequent purchases due to the satisfaction of effectively using the in-game item during the second gameplay session.TL;DR: Microtransactions directly influence matchmaking, rather than skill. Not enough? Here's Activison's argument for why EOMM was necessary over SBMM:Originally posted by Activision Patent US10857468B2: Conventional systems further fail to leverage matchmaking processes in other contexts, such as influencing game-related purchases, suggesting group formations, training/identifying non-player characters, and/or otherwise extending the use of the matchmaking process. These and other drawbacks exist with current matchmaking processes utilized in multiplayer video games.This game is manipulating you. It doesn't care about how good you are. It doesn't care how much fun you have. It cares about your money, and Activision is willing to ruin your lobbies to get it. The only way to win this game is to not play at all. In this case, the house always wins.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t5,341 people found this review helpful500 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t209\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n67.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 2 August, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChanging the name of the game from Modern Warfare II 2022 to Call of Duty isn't going to fix your game.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4,555 people found this review helpful50 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t253\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n50.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 9 November, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease make diffirents launchers for Warzone 2.0, Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III.

I did not purchase this game,nor will I probably ever, the only reason I can review it is because of Warzone 2.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,624 people found this review helpful81 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t70\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n5.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 6 July, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis game has, without a doubt, the single worst main menu I have ever seen...\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,761 people found this review helpful365 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t162\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n358.1 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 6 December, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeason 1 launches 20 GB update10 minutes of verifyingLaunch gameUpdate requires restartLaunch game Shaders optimizingTakes another 5 minutesAll my classes were resetCreate Warzone loadoutLaunch WarzoneGame crashesCan't verify game filesVerifying game files 127 GBUninstall CODWrite this reviewBye.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,349 people found this review helpful839 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t187\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n0.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 7 December, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf we hit 1,000 crashes by the end of the month, i'll post 5 videos of me oiled up and twerking.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,872 people found this review helpful702 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t171\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n142.5 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 30 June, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSBMM is literally destroying the game\t\t\t\n"]
