This is an offline player writing. Yes we exist. Sorry that we spent just 80 euro for your game and not 200-5000$ like other online players or streamers to open your packs. You make tha game worse and worse for us. I know you dont give a damn. So its the last time i will ever buy a product from you guys. Oh also i play on PC. Another thing that you people dont care about! I get it, you are a monopoly. p.s You removed teams endrance in the field to make it faster for online players. You could do that only to UT, JUST SAYING GUYS!!! just a small example of how you destroy immersion and fun for the offline players.I mean you made playing a 4th division game feeling absolutely the same as playing the Champions League final. THANK YOU FOR THAT!\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,826 people found this review helpful80 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t309\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n127.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 28 September, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYear after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC. I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play. \u2192 Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch. \u2192 Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary. \u2192 Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated. \u2192 Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means).  \u2192 Controllers not working properly. \u2192 Game keeps minimising on PC.  \u2192 The game is not opening and launching for so many players. \u2192 Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes.  \u2192 Objectives not counting. \u2192 Not getting XP when completing objectives.  \u2192 The game freezes on the EA FC logo.  \u2192 Stuck in half-time animation. \u2192 Game-play stutter.  \u2192 Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware.  \u2192 Anti-cheat error message.  \u2192 Media questions still make 0 sense. \u2192 Same animations for media interviews and transfers. \u2192 Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here. \u2192 Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again. \u2192 If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and \"enabling it\" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run. Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, which iteration of EA FC will you bring this back and market it as a \"brand new, immersive feature\"?\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,873 people found this review helpful669 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t134\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n9.1 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 28 September, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u280b\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28ba\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2806\u281c\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u283f\u281b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u284f\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28e0\u28e4\u28e4\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28e6\u28e4\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28c4\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bf\u2867\u2807\u2880\u28e4\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28fe\u28ee\u28ed\u28ff\u287b\u28fd\u28d2\u2800\u28e4\u28dc\u28ed\u2810\u2890\u28d2\u2822\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u28fe\u28ff\u2802\u2888\u28bf\u28f7\u28de\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28fe\u287f\u283f\u28ff\u2817\u2808\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u283b\u280b\u2809\u2811\u2800\u2800\u2898\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u281f\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2880\u28f6\u28f6\u2834\u2836\u2800\u2800\u28bd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u2800\u2800\u2823\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u285f\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u281f\u280b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2839\u28ff\u28e7\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2840\u28f4\u2801\u2898\u2859\u2809\u2809\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u28bf\u2817\u2802\u2804\u2800\u28f4\u285f\u2800\u2800\u2843\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t552 people found this review helpful124 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n565.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 28 September, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby purchasing this game you will Receive these itemsBug SimulatorGlitch SimulatorCrash SimulatorStutter Simulatorfreeze Simulator Headache Simulator+ Fifa 23 (renamed to Eafc 24)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------New Updateafter more than 200 hours timeplay here is my review for the gameplaytbh purble place is a better game than fc24 this game is awfuldo you want to win? 71 depth - 5 at back - cutbacks - direct passing - and There you go! you have anything that you need to win now its up to youhow this game works??? its more like rocket league the ball just gonna bounce 1284 times until you concede a goal like bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce finesse shot and yep thats a goal there is no point in defending the ball just gonna bounce back to your opponentyour cdms are man marked by strikers (Yes your cdms are man marked by strikers and the rest of your players too !!!!!!!)90 minutes pressure without lossing stamina and the only option that you have is to make a long pass from your lb to your rb or from your rb to your lb and then you have to wait for your opponent to make a mistake so you can make a move and create yourself a chance to scorefor those whos gonna defend this company and say skill issue let me tell you somethingthere is no skill issue cause this game doesnt require skill anymoreits all about being a rat and have some luck do yourself a favor and stay away of this awful thing ( im not gonna call this thing a game anymore cause its not this thing is not fun or entertaining like it supposed to be)\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t401 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n117.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 27 October, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHaving played FIFA titles competitively and consistently throughout the last 5-6 years, I can safely say without a doubt that this is the  most horrific title ever released.  This may seem like an overreaction (after all, how bad can a reskinned football game be right?!), and I wish it was, but it isn't in the slightest. I will break this down into some broad sections: Gameplay: Where do you start with this. It appears that, for what feels like the third time in a row in FIFA/FC franchises, that the AI is only capable of playing at a high level using high depth, direct passing tactics, that completely negate any form of tactical flexibility or stylistic influence you may wish to have (this may be my FM brain kicking in, but im sure most people dont ALWAYS want to play the same 90 minutes over and over again?). Having been in the elite divisions and consistently finishing FUT champs at around 16-4, I have not seen any variation, besides the starting formation to revert to the standard 4321 meta. Player Flexibility: With the new Evolution system being introduced, I, like many fans, were excited to see what layer of tactical flexibility this could offer to teams in ultimate team. Unfortunately, this feature is SEVERELY disappointing. In classic monopolistic style micro-transaction paradise, more 'premium' upgrades are locked behind what seems to be a ridiculously steep paywall (I am of the opinion that paying upwards of \u00a315 for a single player upgrade is quite frankly outrageous). Furthermore, the restrictions are so draconian that only a select crop of players can be eligible. Take the 'Centurions Midfielder' upgrade, with an increased price of 150k coins (don't try to calculate how many games you would need to play) or 2k fifa points. The ONLY usable player in this selection that would be considered meta is Marcos Llorente (shocker!), and any other would be a waste of hard earned currency/ies. Like most years, the availability of exclusive players is so unbelievably high that you would have to wait until AT LEAST post Xmas for any hope of obtaining top level cards (and that is generous, since i'm basing this off of my experience in previous titles, having playing EVERY weekend league with consistent rewards). Would you like to use your favourite footballer, Kylian Mbappe? That is a shame, since you would need a literal mortgage on fifa points to afford just his services (lets not even get into top tier icon prices!!).  Player Movement: Remarkably, even due to the 'new' engine that was blessed to us two years ago on PC versions, the level of AI stupidity is quite frankly remarkable. Positional play is non-existent to be optimistic, and downright outrageous on the other end of the spectrum. Realistically, the only avenue of scoring is (you guessed it) Step 1: Buy fast wingers with playstyle+s that offer more 'pace' than their stats suggest (Chiesa is a good example), to then cut it back on a plate. There is no variation at the top level of the game, as this is the most achievable way of scoring a goal. The lacklustre player movement also extends to goalkeepers, who not only do NOT save shots with their actual hands (more so a forcefield aura around their gloves, magic!), but fail to make basic saving animations, and often find themselves locked into animations that they are unable to get out of. We've all seen Alisson Becker make a howler as he is diving sideways, despite the ball coming straight at him (I guess?). Predatory Marketing: For what feels like an eternity, EA have been very fast to implement micro transactions into their games without actually considering improving the fundamental gameplay, which in turn would give a more enjoyable experience and thus make people consider spending their hard earned funds on the game. When one of your landmark features in your ultimate team breakdown is the 'Claim All' Button, shouldn't you be looking elsewhere? New packs have been introduced which can set you back a literal weeks shop (if you're not careful). Thankfully there is some pushback in Europe from countries such as Belgium, but more needs to be done to recognise this in built slot machine, which, is also key to note, is listed as a PEGI 3 (ie. EA are perfectly morally ok with the fact that literal children could be gambling money on their game, just to get a virtual card which will be irrelevant in 12 months!!).It is safe to say that this is the worst football game experience I have endured in a while. My likelihood of buying the next title is, for the first time ever, hit a new ground zero. I would encourage others to perform something similar until actual, effective, and purposeful change has been implemented to allow for tactical flexibility, gameplay consistency, and a fair playing field for all those who wish to play (from casual to professional players). \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t760 people found this review helpful576 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t128\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n4.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 28 October, 2023\nProduct received for free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'd rather buy WinRAR\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t363 people found this review helpful30 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n110.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 14 October, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUPDATED REVIEW:Please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours I have sunk into it.I won't be completely critical of the game and I'll give credit to a couple of things, most notably the gameplay. I like the animations and the motion of the players, they are fun to control. I play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great. Players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively (especially against ultimate difficulty) but with practice, you get there. Attacking is satisfying too, I like the different dribbling styles, although R1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered, but even still, I am happy that it's possible to dribble past players in this year's game and score some lovely solo goals. I play purely offline, as where I am currently located I just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience.HOWEVER - despite EA releasing updates, not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many MANY others face, which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some, lag and game crashes. I would not want to know how many of those hours I have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just won't play. Sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily, but upon the next launch, it just doesn't work again. This to me is unacceptable. They are aware of the problem, yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released. The hell I've been through to sort it should never be required to play any game. I paid \u00a380, but I feel like EA owe me a year's salary for the amount of work I've done on their game for them. Crooks.Stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it. Imagine playing an F1 game, but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself, you've crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused \u00a3500 million worth of damage, you'd say 'Forget it' and toss it in the bin. The same goes for football games. You need precision and reactions because timing is important. You can't do that with 3-second stutters intermittently during a match. How can nobody have seen this? I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander.It was a new era for the franchise, a fresh start, so I allowed myself to believe that things may be different, but it just isn't the case for any of the offline modes. If you think adding cut scenes of players winning the Balon d'Or (where nobody even speaks other than some announcer, which freaks me out) and an open-top bus parade of trophies you've won (which is cool the first time, but it is the same every single time after) then you don't understand why we play football games - WE WANT TO PLAY, NOT SIT THERE AND WATCH SILENT MOVIES. Is this their attempt at making it more immersive? Disaster.True, some promising ideas were introduced, like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode, but here's the thing - that was bugged when it was released. Imagine working on a new feature, but for it not to work properly. What I mean is, that you can't fire coaches, you'll lock the game and have no chance to back out. I actually hope it doesn't get patched, because it doesn't matter, it tells us what we already know - they don't care. It's a shame because I think that if they'd just put more effort into it, this could've been a really good game. The foundation is there with the gameplay, and that's the heart of any good football game. But why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more? The amount of work they put into 'create a team' for example, which was just uninspiring, is what I am talking about. Put that work into actually making a comprehensive, immersive career mode. 'Create a team' was fantastic in the F1 game, it works in that circumstance, but for a manager mode on a football game? It isn't what we want. For those who can't be bothered to read all that: you'll feel just like Mugatu from Zoolander - It really is the same face.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t545 people found this review helpful81 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t37\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n1.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 4 October, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdid i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? insanity is doing the exact same f*cking thing over and over again, expecting sh*t to change... that. is. crazy.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t551 people found this review helpful120 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n134.6 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 2 October, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGood game like always, especially the gambling mechanics designed for kids are something that is really innovative!\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t529 people found this review helpful19 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n529.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 25 October, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRubbish, poor optimisation for PC.
