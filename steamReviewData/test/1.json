I'm now at the stage where I can do it on my own.  I think they did an amazing job with this game.  It doesn't matter how old you are, this is so fun.  I highly recommend this game.

Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the \"meta\" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 dragons. What more could you want?\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t546 people found this review helpful20 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n106.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 6 June, 2019\nMost enjoyable grind everI\u2019m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you \u2013 a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That\u2019s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you\u2019re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you\u2019ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can\u2019t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing \u2013 you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you\u2019re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It\u2019s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it\u2019s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There\u2019s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you\u2019re not very good you\u2019ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone\u2019s session who\u2019s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it\u2019s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That\u2019s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It\u2019s not something special, I guess it\u2019s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It\u2019s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you\u2019ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it\u2019s a must have for coop lovers. ProsGood graphicsA lot of contentVery challengingA lot of monsters to huntNo p2w crapNice coopConsPerformance could be slightly betterWhile there are a lot of monsters, many of them feel too similar to each otherMy curator page \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,267 people found this review helpful11 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t97\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n388.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 23 March, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEdit: Just an update on this review. After almost 400 hours and coming back to it a few years later during the back to MHW campaign, memories of this amazing game has returned..And I can without a doubt say in terms of gameplay, this was the best game I have EVER played. Nothing else like it. Can't wait for MH Wilds!!! So excited! I would easily spend hundreds to buy the next successor to World. Heck, I'd happily go homeless to buy it.Previous Review:This game is absolutely fantastic and is a blast with friends.Two things I HIGHLY recommend for all new players.1. DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t501 people found this review helpful281 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n618.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 1 June, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou're like a domesticated cat that is allowed outside.

Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t777 people found this review helpful25 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n867.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 9 November, 2018\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, \"do all the quests.\" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t348 people found this review helpful13 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n3,316.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 14 June, 2019\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPretty fun, both solo and multi, don't believe the mixed reviews those were all due to the bad launch, the game is a very solid edition to the franchise and as its own game.
