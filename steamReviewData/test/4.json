I have puchased this game years ago and now they block me from playing it unless i forefeit my right to privacy? I consider this to be fraud.Edit: here are some examples:information that they collect includes: \u2013 Nickname, phone number, SteamID64(*), purchase history, etc. to provide and operate the game;*\u2013 Nickname, email address, device information, and records of the issues you experience (to provide customer service)*, and \u2013 Email address, gender, age, country of residence, language, and information for delivering goods (i.e. name, postal address, and phone number)(for participation in the survey, and other events).* When you participate in social features (such as in-game chat), the information that you disclose is public information. We may store and access it, and it may be read, copied, collected or used by other users without your consent.*When they name a reason for collecting this and that information it doesn't legally bind them as far as I can tell.It seems to be just an explanation for the reader, especially considering this list is under \"information we collect\" and not \"how we use your information\", that comes later.who they share the information with includes: marketing platforms and providers of analytics services relating to player behavior*, in order to tailor the Service and to conduct marketing activities *this does not mean that they only share information that's necessary for the analytics, it means that they are allowed to share what they have with a company that provides those analytics services.player behavior is also not limited to ingame activities, it can be simply activity of you, the player, as far as the wording goes.they also retain the right to give out your information if their company is aquired or merged.  We may also  share your information where such disclosure is essential to comply with a legal obligation or a lawful data access request, pursuant to a merger or acquisition, with our affiliates for the purposes described in this Policy, or where you have otherwise provided* your consent or at your direction.*\"or where you have otherwise provided your consent\" reads like \"We may share your information in such and such cases and also however we see fit (as long as it's legal)\" bruh\ud83d\udc80please check out the privacy policy to see for yourself: https://na.battlegrounds.pubg.com/pp-steam/it's all there and not super hard to understand.tldr: privacy unknown: bad game \ud83d\ude14 \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4,827 people found this review helpful173 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t123\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n0.6 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 17 December, 2021\nProduct received for free\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIts Gonna Be F2P From January 12 2022, Dont Buy It Now and Just Wait For a Few More Weeks! \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,875 people found this review helpful81 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t77\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n1,499.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 5 August, 2019\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI've always asked myself, how can people play a game for 1000+ hours and then give it a thumbs down? Then I played PUBG.The European servers are in tatters, ruined by cheaters. I log in to 4 or 5 new perm-ban reports each session, but nothing changes. Cheats are readily available and are pre-installed in internet cafes in many parts of the world. Hit the death cam to spectate a HUYATV or DOUYUTV account and watch them 6x spray you with an AK from 100 yards, every shot hitting you in the head.And it's not, GET GUD or REKT M8 - it's just sad. It takes all of the fun out of the game. I've played for over 1000 hours, I've paid for season passes and I've been promised changes and improvements - it just isn't happening. The devs don't care about about their player base and they don't listen to feedback.PUBG still offers something other BR games don't and this is the game I want to play. When this game is good, it's probably one of my favourite games ever - certainly the game I've played the most.I can put up with bugs, I can put up with poor geometry and I can put up with not being the best player at this game. But I can't put up with cheats.Don't REGION LOCK CHINA, build a better cheat engine. I will happily play against anyone from anywhere in the world, but I don't want to play against cheaters.It makes me incredibly sad to have to give this game a thumbs down.:: ...213 hours later... ::This game is now broken beyond belief. 100% CPU usage, stuttering everywhere (regardless of how good your machine is), cheaters in every single game, complete radio silence from the devs. Don't bother.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t11,645 people found this review helpful2,276 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n207.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 24 June, 2017\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive), after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found, you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60-70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...This is what will happen every game, you'll feel rage, anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one.

They have made A LOT of money out of us, but they still refused to fix their game, they kept releasing broken updates while turning a blind eye on actual problems such as rampant cheating. They said there would be no micro transactions before the game left EA; they lied. They said the game left early access; they lied, it's still not as optimized as a game this big should be. They are sueing Epic Games because they are seeing a dip into their profits and they are too self absorbed to realize their own incompetence is turning players away, not a better competitor.This company is interested in creating more paid content, they don't care about fixing what they already have now, they don't care about you.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,300 people found this review helpful65 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t124\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n1,269.6 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 25 June, 2020\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter almost 1000 hours of playing, it's time for me to voice my thoughts. I've owned and played PUBG since the official release on steam, and I've been there through the good, the bad and the ugly. Over two years in and the game runs like it should. The maps are a mixed bag but the weapons and other content is nice. The variety of guns now give you options to suit your play style. However, with the recent changes I can't recommend the game and not lie to myself and others. Bots were recently added and they're so brainless they just get in your way. The biggest problem is the HACKING!!! PUBG has never cared to ban hackers, they review your reports one-by-one and seldom ban hackers. I've seen speed hacks, aim bots, no recoil, you name it. It's honestly ruined the game when you can't win because a hacker will sneak around and ambush you. When hackers are gone for good i'll play PUBG all day long and change my review. As it is, the game is dead to me right now.---EDIT 7/22/20 new season, reworked Sanhok. Map is improved a lot. Hackers still problem. Salty comments spreading like wildfire.
