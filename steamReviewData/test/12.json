Unfortunately, this \"uniqueness\" has left Gaijin with little real competition over the years. What started off as a \"free to play\" title has over time become less and less free. Gaijin keeps adding nations and vehicles, while at the same time increasing repair costs and lowering RP/SL gain. A premium account isn't enough to comfortably progress anymore, now you also have to buy premium vehicles in every nation.For the new players reading this, Gaijin has recently admitted that they balance free vehicles around a negative SL income for average players. That means they WANT you to lose money by playing, so you'll be forced to buy a top tier premium vehicle.This isn't just greedy, it also destroys the matchmaker and the balance of the game. Since you only profit using premium vehicles they often end up being spammed. In battlerating 8.7, more than half the players on each team are in premium tanks. This results in rampant \"one death leaving\". These players only spawn their premium tank and leave when it's destroyed, leaving their team in a bad position. Sometimes the premium is their only tank for the tier, othertimes it's because \"free\" tanks aren't worth the high cost to repair.Gaijin and their purposefully frustrating economy is ultimately to blame for this. There's so many other issues and scandals I could bring up, like how you can't repair or extinguish flames on your new tank before unlocking \"parts\" and \"FPE\". Gaijin wants you to pay gold to skip the grind for these essential tools.In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. That might seem hypocritical considering my hours spent in this game, but believe me. It's new players who suffer the most. Gaijin doesn't care about me, you, or the playerbase. Don't make the same mistake as me. Find another game that values your input, and respects your time.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit, July 26: Much has happened since May and the publishing of this review.Most importantly, on 13th of June, Gaijin published a roadmap of planned economy changes. Most recent roadmap update as of this edit: https://warthunder.com/en/news/8374-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-battle-pass-available-in-simulator-battles-enThis was an unprecedented event, as we have never seen this much transparency from the Devs before.Despite tempered expecations and a healthy dose of skepticism on the part of myself and many others, the roadmap is actually progressing according to schedule.One of the key criticisms in my review, that of SL (Silver Lions) has been (largely) adressed, earnings were increased across the board, and repair costs adjusted.All ground vehicles now have a basic version of Parts and FPE available from the start without needing to unlock the Parts and FPE modifications: basic parts can repair components to partial functionality, while basic FPE is single-use.Aircraft with countermeasures now start with a basic flare loadout, while mixed / full countermeasure loadouts require unlocking the flare modification.You no longer have to pay repair cost when teamkilled (finally), and newly purchased premium vehicles now include 15 free backups (extra spawns). Backups are a consumable however, and as such it doesn't fully alleviate the \"one death leaving\" issue, as players will quickly spend their 15 backups and continue this behavior after. Gaijin needs to consider making the backup permament.I don't mean to diminish these changes, they were sorely needed, but there's still a long way to go.As of today, no changes have been made to RP (Research Point) gain, which is the main cause for slow progression, especially in Ground Forces Mode.The matchmaking system desperately needs a major overhaul, and battle ratings need to be decompressed. While matchmaking changes are mentioned in the roadmap, it remains to be seen how Gaijin chooses to handle this issue.All in all, while the changes are positive so far and show a lot of promise going forward, my review will stay unchanged until the roadmap is concluded, and the full effects can be seen.Lastly I want to thank you all so much for your attention and gracious awards! Thanks to you I have amassed just over 2.5 Million Steam Points! That's mind-boggling, I could've never anticipated this much engagement writing my little review back in May. I apologize for the late update, and let's hope for more good news.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t8,819 people found this review helpful128 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t1,014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n2,511.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 6 May, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLook at my hours. How many of them do you think I was actually happy while playing? I will never get that time back.Edit: For the naysayers who've been commenting \"but you've played the game for X hours, you must enjoy it\"I used to enjoy the game. I started playing in 2014 when I bought my first \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 laptop, because I didn't have the ability to play many newer games, and didn't want to spend money on games I couldn't run regardless. I loved the idea of driving around in realistic WW2 era tanks, because I'm a big fan of military history, and even studied it in college. My first hours in Tank Arcade, before I learned what crew skills did, before I learned the subtle nuances of armor types, and calibers, and shell types, etc, I had the most fun I've ever had in video games, playing War Thunder.Like with so many other live service games in this modern age though, I've had to watch a game that I used to love get progressively worse, patch after patch, update after update. I watched the economy move from a F2P model (albeit with a small bit of grinding) to a \"pay to progress at anything more than a snails pace.\" To put it into perspective, I unlocked the F-82 within a month of only playing Air Arcade and only F2P using the few boosters the game gave you back when I first started. I started grinding the German air tree this year, and just hit Rank 3 planes last month, WITH premium.Top tier past 7.7 is an absolute atrocious mess. CAS was already strong before, back when 8.0 was top BR, but now, with the addition of AGMs, Drones, Helis, thermals, etc, I die more often to Air vehicles in Tank RB, than I do to actual tanks. And having a bad match at top BR means you have to go back to sub 6.7 for atleast a dozen matches just to recoup your SL losses to continue grinding. The games economy has been absolutely trashed by Gaijin to almost force players to buy premium time, and premium vehicles, just to make profit to save up for higher tier vehicles.So yea, at 2200hrs, I realized I hate this stupid game. But I'll keep playing it until my premium runs out, because I didn't waste money for nothing.Second Edit: Yesterday, May 19th 2023, Gaijin released a community post accusing those of us who have rightful complaints about the games economy being catered only towards those who spend copious amounts of money, as review bombing their game and driving away new players. They simultaneously made excuses for why why they want to keep making the grind in the game even harder for both new and old players. Instead of taking accountability for how they as a company have failed both new and veteran players, they have decided to shift the blame onto the players themselves. This should be a sign to all players, new and old, that Gaijin absolutely does not give a crap about us, and only cares about their potential profits. Please, I beg of you, fellow fans, go find something else to play instead. GHPC is a relatively inexpensive tank sim for the ground RB lovers. DCS world and IL-2 Sturmovik exists for those of you who play air. If Gaijin wants to blame the playerbase for why their game is failing, then lets give them the excuse they've made, and leave.Third Edit: If you're gonna use my review for your Youtube video or gaming article (Here's looking at you PC Gamer) atleast use the full review instead of picking and choosing sentences to confirm your own bias.Fourth Edit Post Economy \"Update\": Once again Gaijin has gaslighted and lied to the community. The changes we got were the absolute bare minimum, with base SL gains across the board being nerfed, so that SL modifiers, despite being increased on paper, actually give equal or even less SL than before. Repair costs for the most exorbitant vehicles were lowered, but vehicles with average or below average repair costs for their tier weren't touched, or were slightly increased. The first tank I noticed was the BTR-80A as I've spent the past 3 days grinding it. It went from 3.5k yesterday with some modifications (I haven't spaded it yet) to over 3.8k today with the same modifications. While a 300ish SL increase may not seem like much, thats only for one tank in a lineup of 5. Several premium vehicles had their repair costs increased as well, like the IS-6. Without premium, in a 7.0 Russian lineup, 5 kills and 4 assists with 4 deaths net me a -3.2k SL loss despite using a premium tank in that lineup. So yea, its all been a big sham\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t7,457 people found this review helpful428 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t810\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n199.3 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 20 May, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"also, review bombing will not cause modiying or nullifying in-game prices - if the game is shut down, no one wins\"well gaijin, i don't need to win. i just need YOU to lose.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,131 people found this review helpful10 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n1,838.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 21 May, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear new players to WT,Have played this game for years, have sunk more money into this game than a human should sink into a F2P game and I cannot see a reason to do either anymore.It used to be you could grind the game for a week with a premium vehicle and have a bunch of stuff unlocked and plenty of Silver Lions (The in-game currency AKA SL), it wasn't a requirement it was a nice bonus that warranted you spending actual money on the game.Now you need to be premium to break even in. And I do mean break even. Because of previous economy changes, you're heavily punished for losing but only slightly rewarded for winning in terms of post-game SL and Research Points, you typically lose lions unless you're using a premium account.To the old heads,\"Get gud then scrub\" \"I win lots, so it doesn't affect me.\"A game's base economy shouldn't punish the people who perform poorly, which is the MAJORITY of the playerbase. It's pure greed that made them realize that since most games are carried by a few top performers they can milk the majority of the playerbase for premium just to be able to stay afloat. And the thing is, it DOES affect you. Because soon you'll be playing a dead game with no players present.To Gaijin,You're milking the cow dry. Ease up your grip or you're going to kill it. \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t11,056 people found this review helpful5,651 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t2,153\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n646.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 18 May, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapolgy for bad englishwhere were u wen economy diei was at house eating dorito whenphone ring\"Economy is kil\"\"no\"\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,020 people found this review helpful650 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t98\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n1,910.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 16 January, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe only game where the developers have to beg their player base to stop leaking classified military documents\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,214 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t59\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n2,055.5 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 18 May, 2023\n As someone with almost 1600 hours on this \"game\", don't waste your time on this game with a ridiculous grind.  Basic explanation of the in game economy This \"game\", like many other free to play titles features an in game economy which includes a non premium \"Silver Lions\" and a premium (bought with real life money) \"Golden Eagles\" currency. These currencies are used to purchase in game vehicles and various other items, with the latter \"Golden Eagles\" currency used to by premium content which lets you speed up the grinding of new vehicles. While this all looks fine on paper, Gaijin, the creator of this \"game\", have been abusing economy for years now to milk as much money from its playerbase as possible. This is done by making the grind extremely difficult (especially at the stages with more modern vehicles) for players that have not spent any money on the \"game\". This difficulty then puts pressure on the free-to-play player base to spend money.  And its only been getting worse. Very recently, Gaijin has released a patch that changed the economy and balancing of the game. These changes have made it even more difficult by forcing players to grind more vehicles (a good portion of which are often not fun to use) to reach the ones they are interested in playing. Another cruel change is the increase of repair costs, which is an amount of \"Silver Lions\" you need to pay in order to repair your vehicles and use them again after dying in them. This increase in cost means players have to earn more \"Silver Lions\" from their battles on average in order to profit, making the grind even less sustainable for free-to-play players. In fact, a staff member on the official WarThunder forum even stated that the grind was only designed to be profitable with premium vehicles/content.  TLDR; The devs have, and will continue to ruin the game by being greedy and making as much money as possible off of the player base, do NOT play this garbage, it is NOT worth the time investment.  \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,942 people found this review helpful23 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t115\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Recommended\n146.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 21 April, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I'm out of Silver to repair my tanks to play the game I'm not going to buy additional funds for real money, I'm just going to quit playing the game.Change this stupid policy that repair costs more than the reward of even won match. Would not recommend, wasted hours upgrading to the better tank ranks when you can't even play them. Also free repair of the vehicle takes couple days. Is it a joke?Will not comeback untill some changes to the system are made.After the \"Economy balance update\":Thank you for changing the grind from \"imposible to do\" to \"unberable to do\".

I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.It is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.After so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin's enemy.There are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).Now the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.But I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.There are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. But i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. Warthunder \"can\"  become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.\t\t\t\n"]
