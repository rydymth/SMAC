When researching for perfomance-tests of \"Wallpaper Engine\" I didn't quite find a review that was useful for me so i decided to get the software and test it myself. It should be noted that this review will ignore other apsects such as the content of the software.Hardware Specs: CPU...............................i5 6400 (no overclock with BCLK)CPU cooler......................AIO watercooling loop from NZXTGPU...............................GTX 980TI (MSI - no manual overclock)RAM...............................16GB DDR4 (GSkill - 2133MHz - dual kit)Motherboard.....................ASUS ROG Maximus VIII RangerSSD................................Samsung 850 Evo (Only for OS, Steam and apps on HDD)OS..................................Windows 10 ProfessionalTest: The software (run in non 64-bit mode) will be tested in two scenarios. Arsenal wallpaper will be used for all tests.1) Hardware usage will be observed while the System sits idle for 10 minutes without any other applications running in the background. The tool for HW monitoring is \"OpenHardwareMonitor\". This testing scenario will be repeated for the wallpaper presets Low, Medium and High and a standard windows desktop background as reference.

Again, Arsenal wallpaper is used, this time on preset High. As there are different options to choose, which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen (Keep Running, Stop, Pause) a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background.I chose the Benchmark Scene from Rainbow Six Siege with the graphics on ultra preset. Here are the results: FPS in RB6-Benchmark   RB6S MinFPS AvgFPS MaxFPS   None 102 173 327   Stop 93 172 264   Pause 100 172 296   Keep Running 58 171 299 Conclusion: As we have been able to see, there are slight differences in terms of hardware usage. I was surprised that the software did much better than expected, but the results may differ, considering community-made wallpapers may use more resources. The CPU temperature values may not be very reliable due to the CPU being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale. Wallpaper Engine does also have an impact on gaming performance, which can be kept to a minimum using the \"Pause\" or \"Stop\" behaviour for fullscreen applications.With a hardware config as \"enthusiast\" as mine, i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application, but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig, i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit. At the end of the day, you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a$$ (a$$ can be taken literally) wallpapers or not.I do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t995 people found this review helpful804 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t72\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n187.3 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 1 April, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't download Hentai wallpapers because your friend can see them in your Subscribed to box\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,534 people found this review helpful1,095 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t112\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n2.1 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 23 March, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't download Hentai wallpapers because your friend can see them in your Subscribed to box.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,534 people found this review helpful206 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t97\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n64.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 30 December, 2020\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'll save you the time and spare you from having to read unfunny anime weeaboo reviews that mainly consist of weebs saying \"LoL i CaN gEt HeNtAi ANime GiRlS on MY dEkStOp\" by simply saying:It's good, works well, changes your background and is probably what you're looking for.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t339 people found this review helpful555 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n257.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 26 May, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDidn't realize you can click ok to apply the wallpaper so I had the application running for 237 hours straight.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t628 people found this review helpful310 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n3,263.6 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 11 July, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat I expected:-epic animated wallpapersWhat I got:-4K Anime tits\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t412 people found this review helpful184 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n10.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 21 February, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvery cool but i will warn you there is an ungodly amount of anime titties in the wallpaper selection\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t682 people found this review helpful337 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t90\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n46.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 3 August, 2020\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twallpaper move\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t294 people found this review helpful31 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n44.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 11 August, 2019\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAchievement spoiler for dark theme: use Konami code on the 'about' section to unlock the worthiness of dark mode \ud83e\udc1d  \ud83e\udc1d  \ud83e\udc1f  \ud83e\udc1f \ud83e\udc1c \ud83e\udc1e \ud83e\udc1c \ud83e\udc1e \ud83c\udd71\ufe0f \ud83c\udd70\ufe0f [Enter]Edit: spelling, grammar, code above \ud83e\udc1d, and small details\t\t\t\n"]
