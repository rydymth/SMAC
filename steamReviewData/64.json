If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. Forza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. Is Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy.  I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. If you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. With 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. At the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,030 people found this review helpful120 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n203.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 20 May, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t---{Graphics}---\u2611You forget what reality is\u2610 Beautiful\u2610 Good\u2610 Decent\u2610 Bad\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\u2610 Free Fire---{Gameplay}---\u2610 Very good\u2611 Good\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\u2610 Mehh\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\u2610 Just don't---{Audio}---\u2610 Eargasm\u2611Very good\u2610 Good\u2610 Not too bad\u2610 Bad\u2610 I'm now deaf---{Audience}---\u2610 Kids\u2610 Teens\u2610 Adults\u2611 All---{PC Requirements}---\u2610 Check if you can run paint\u2610 Potato\u2611 Decent\u2610 Fast\u2610 Rich boi\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{Difficulity}---\u2610 Just press 'W'\u2610 Easy\u2610 Significant brain usage\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\u2610 Difficult\u2610 Dark Souls---{Grind}---\u2610 Nothing to grind\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\u2611 Average grind level\u2610 Too much grind\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding---{Story}---\u2610 No Story\u2611 Some lore\u2610 Average\u2610 Good\u2610 Lovely\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life---{Game Time}---\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\u2610 Short\u2610 Average\u2610 Long\u2611 To infinity and beyond---{Price}---\u2610 It\u2019s free!\u2610 Worth the price\u2611 If it's on sale\u2610 If u have some spare money left\u2610 Not recommended\u2610 You could also just burn your money---{Bugs}---\u2610 Never heard of\u2611 Minor bugs\u2610 Can get annoying\u2610 Cyberpunk 2077\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs---{?/10}---\u26101\u26102\u26103\u26104\u26105\u26106\u26107\u26108\u26119\u261010\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t619 people found this review helpful20 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n81.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 9 March, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t245 people found this review helpful8 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n96.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 17 December, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbetter than horizon 5 definitely\t\t\t\n"]
