For someone like me that grew up playing SWAT 4 pretty much every day after school on my dad's old Dell PC this game brings back a lot of nostalgia for me which makes it even better. I think I speak for all of us that played SWAT 4 when I say we have all been waiting and seething for a similar title that can scratch that itch - Ready or Not does just that. The game is fantastic in every single aspect. I also love how punishing and difficult it can be at times. The margin for error is very small, which just adds to the realism. The game very much fits the \"Early Access\" model at this current state and content is neither here nor there in my book. At the moment there are currently 6 vastly different maps, a hotel, a gas station, a crack house, a port, a farm and a car dealership. All 6 of aforementioned maps are beautifully crafted with the visuals immediately immersing you in the world you are playing in. The sound design is awesome as well, might I add. The sound of explosions, flashbangs, the guns, they sound and feel impactful, something even AAA studios fail to replicate at times. The AI are either good or straight up stupid at times, they are definitely the one thing that needs the most work. But I find that most of the time they do work relatively fine. I hope to see the implementation of achievements - which would be cool to grind for/incentivise us to play - and more customisation - that stays true to real life, of course, Jesus forbid we get another RS6 - and potentially more weapons to fool around with. The game comes in expensive at around 35 bucks but if you are looking to get your tactical shooter fix, Ready or Not will do just that for you.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t509 people found this review helpful244 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n40.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 5 March, 2022\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcaught a terrorist wearing a bulletproof vest, a respirator, a kevlar helmet, and carrying an auto-shotgun inside of a hotel who was holding 2 unarmed innocent people hostage.
