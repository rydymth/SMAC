While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. \"Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older\". And then I play Witcher 3. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....\"Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?\" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ? And I got this game for 3$. 3$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the \"Witcher 3 TV show\". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since GTA San Andreas. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.Thank you CD Projekt Red. You guys are a gem. I know its 5 years late and I don't know why it took me 5 years to play this, but better late than never.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,634 people found this review helpful56 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t134\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n178.1 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 15 December, 2020\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe worst thing about this game is that we'll never get to experience it for the first time again.10/10\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t5,376 people found this review helpful128 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n194.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 28 May, 2017\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis game made me so miserable . The writing can be as funny as heartbreaking The Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard A lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )Pro : The whole game Con : Absolutely nothing It's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t7,929 people found this review helpful1,061 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t26\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n208.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 16 June, 2017\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt reviewMonsters? \u2714People who are worse than monsters? \u2714Naked girls? \u2714More naked girls? \u2714Even more naked girls? \u2714Nude scenes? \u2714Superb voice acting? \u2714Mind-blowingly good storyline? \u2714An amazing 1st DLC, worth every penny? \u2714An even better 2nd DLC? \u27145 Gigantic open world areas? \u2714 (Sorry Skyrim Skellige alone is as big as you) Beautiful environment? \u2714New Game +? \u2714No micro transactions? \u2714Ubisoft?

In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do. There should be more games like this for us seniors. The graphics were exellent. I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games. The visual aspects of the game were superb, realistic and sometimes even breathtaking. The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated. The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved. Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent work.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,497 people found this review helpful1,122 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t137\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n104.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 26 January, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI threw the baby into the oven.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,592 people found this review helpful51 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t190\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n219.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 10 June, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar.
