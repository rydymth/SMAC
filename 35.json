It's great. Certainly not intuitive for a guy that's never played anything like this, but I relished the challenge. I had no idea what I was doing at first: I died many times, and progressed slowly. Used Google for UESP for game info, and that helped tremendously. I made it to Level 83, sort of ran out of things to do, so created a new character, and am playing it differently. I'm a Stormcloak this time around. Enjoying my second go round immensely!\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,748 people found this review helpful21 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t309\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n0.8 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 25 June, 2020\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOriginal versions here if you want to get it due to it being hidden on the steam store.https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/https://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/https://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/https://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/https://store.steampowered.com/app/202485/Skyrim_High_Resolution_Texture_Pack_Free_DLC/ \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t3,432 people found this review helpful78 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n0.3 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 6 March, 2019\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you want the original Skyrim game + DLCs,Steam and Bethesda keeps it hidden here:https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/and the DLCs here:https://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/https://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/https://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/https://store.steampowered.com/app/202485/Skyrim_High_Resolution_Texture_Pack_Free_DLC/ \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,143 people found this review helpful36 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t94\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n8.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 7 June, 2022\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI have now purchased skyrim 5 separate times...And If you want the original Skyrim game + DLCs,Steam and Bethesda keeps it hidden here:https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/https://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/https://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/https://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/https://store.steampowered.com/app/202485/Skyrim_High_Resolution_Texture_Pack_Free_DLC/ \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,474 people found this review helpful833 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t109\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n348.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 6 August, 2021\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti dumped sven's body in a river and found him in eastmarch 10/10\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1,977 people found this review helpful89 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t278\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n312.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 6 December, 2023\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks, Bethesda.

Once you start playing it, you'll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you'll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they've already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It's a form of collective madness, and there's no way to combat it. What's that? You have a job to go to? Well... who's going to return Meridia's Beacon? Kids to feed? That's nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder's Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn't about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!Skyrim's like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn't because it can be scary and gruesome, and you're an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn't either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It's a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard's monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally 'anyone with a pulse'.Yes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they're not Skyrim. They don't have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard's particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin' good.Jeremy Soule's soundtrack helps. It's not often I'll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to 'Distant Horizons' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it's like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.If you're one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn't played Skyrim... don't. Run far, far away, and don't look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment; worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won't stop pestering you, you'll suddenly turn on them and scream \"Fus Ro Dah!\", and they'll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. \"Don't be a sad freak, Dad. It's embarrassing.\"I have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin's fanged maw, and Todd Howard's malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It's too late for me. I'm a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools! \n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2,317 people found this review helpful55 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n90.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 29 December, 2018\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you want OLDRIM, here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/Like so, people can see.\t\t\t\n"]
