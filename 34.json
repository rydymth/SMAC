There's a lot of things I used to be able to do, in real life and in gaming that I really miss.I think playing this daily will help me a lot, as well as helping me to git gud at PvP games if my hand/wrist pains eventually go away.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t271 people found this review helpful188 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n13.5 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 8 August, 2020\nProduct received for free\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTurns potato aim into less potato aim.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t257 people found this review helpful329 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n1.9 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 23 March, 2021\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti learnt that i can't aim\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t188 people found this review helpful151 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n2,804.0 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 1 January, 2023\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti still cant aim\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t164 people found this review helpful12 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n27.2 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 28 June, 2020\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst off, a great aim trainer! Download and try it, how can't you go wrong it's free.I never used to aim train till I started play Apex Legends, I had even bought Kovaak 2.0: The Meta as well but I keep comping back to Aim Lab because how clean, user friendly, and easy it is to just load up and train. No bullThe best part of Aim Lab is the stat tracking, wow I fixed so many micro things I never knew I did, this thing told me I was looking at the bottom half of my screen too much. wtf??? Better then that, it taught me HOW to fix it, told me drills to do that help. AKA solutions, not just you do this, fix it.One criticism, I wish ALL the different modes there are were more pushed. You go under \"Training\" for the basic modes but \"TASKS\" on the bottom left brings up 30+ more training sims, its crazy but I didn't find this out till about 3 or 4 hours after playing and clicking around randomly. I can imagine someone playing and leaving not knowing.My favorite is the Pentakill mode, very fun to do after the core training is doneThis is hands down the best and its FREE.Thank you to Aim Lab team, you have helped me and my aim :)\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t213 people found this review helpful313 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n38.5 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 7 July, 2021\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow I can kill afk people.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t225 people found this review helpful262 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n0.4 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 22 January, 2022\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow I can close Chrome tabs in one click\t\t\t\n"]
