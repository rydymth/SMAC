I'm a disabled gamer and the controls are very accessible. I normally don't play early access games but this one is good as it is now.Update for the release edition: Yes, still very good.

Some games now have budgets and cast lists that rival movies. Gaming can be like sitting down for an elegant ten-course meal at a fancy restaurant. But sometimes you just want a handful of m&ms.This game is a bag of m&ms.There's no nutritional value, it's not burdened with plot or story or fancy graphics or forks or plates or anything that's standing between you and shoving what you want directly into your facehole. It's that kind of game where you're just going to play one more run and sort of absentmindedly grab another handful of chocolate. Okay, one more run after this. I'll just have a few more. Oh, I've eaten a pound of chocolate.This game is delicious.\t\t\t\n", "\n\r\n\t\t\t\t820 people found this review helpful6 people found this review funny\t\t\t\t10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended\n24.7 hrs on record\n\n\n\n\nPosted: 8 January, 2022\nEarly Access Review\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis game is ridiculously good for its pricepoint.
